# Modern Java Microservice - Car Storage

Car Storage is a service responsible for storing cars data.
It is an example of a modern, reactive and lightweight microservice written with Java. 

- Creator: Damian Åšniatecki (https://www.linkedin.com/in/damiansn/)
- Stage: early development
- Version: 0.3.0

Car storage is written in a reactive paradigm. It makes it ideal for low-latency, high-throughput workloads.
Additionally, its public API is secured by JWT token. Such token can be generated by an OAuth2 & OpenId connect provider 
(e.g. Keycloak).
